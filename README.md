Why this project?
====================
1. A simple native audio player API wrapper
2. Others found were complex & not able to embed.
3. Some even involved compilation using NDK
4. 


Getting started
====================


Why the name 'AudioWife'?
=========================
This relates with yet another Android AudioRecorder library project that is coming soon. 
So thought of it as analogous to a married couple where the wife is an active Player, hence AudioWife
for Audio Player and husband being a listener, hence AudioHusband for Audio Recorder.
