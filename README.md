[Android MediaPlayer](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/android/android_mediaplayer.htm)


Why this project?
====================
1. Native audio player wrapper


Getting started
====================


Why the name 'AudioWife'?
=========================
This relates with yet another Android AudioRecorder library project that is coming soon. 
So thought of it as analogous to a married couple where A wife is an active Player, hence AudioWife
for AudioPlayer and husband being a listener, hence AudioHusband for Audio Recorder.
